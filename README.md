mycelium.py is a library of various helper functions.


R_spring_layout_demo.ipynb simulates layout of letter "R". See the top of each notebook input cell for step-by-step annotations. You can change which letter you want to layout near the top of the notebook as indicated. Such notebooks for each letter were used to create Fig. 4 & 6, and Supplementary Figs 3 & 4.

100_replicates_demo.ipynb simulates graph connectivity under various ligation regimes. This was used for Fig 5.
